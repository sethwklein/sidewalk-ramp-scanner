# Sidewalk Ramp Scanner

Name not final.

## Problem Definition

Sidewalk crosswalk ramps are not cleared well during the winter in
Portland, Maine.

## User Stories

As a wheelchair user, I can find a route that uses only sidewalk ramps
someone has checked.

As a smart phone user, I can get notifications when I'm near a sidewalk
ramp that hasn't been checked.

As a smart phone user, I can report a ramp that hasn't been cleared.

As a smart phone user, I can report a ramp that has been cleared.

## Features

* map of ramps
    * ramps have "age"
    * or maybe an admin resets when there's a storm
* browse old ramps
* route finding that avoids old ramps
* report on ramp (good or bad)
    * bad with photo (required or optional?)
    * maybe require gps (not too tight)
    * these things might help avoid having to require user signup

## Project Status

Some people are thinking about it. No one is working on it. If you'd like
to, feel free to file an issue.

We're looking for the city data set that shows where all the ramps are
(hopefully!)
